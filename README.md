

 Idea:

The Solution is that we have created a chatbot that responds to the request made by the customer by searching the DB for solutions. 
Our chatbot is capable enough to interpret to all queries of the customers , analyze them and understand the intent of the queries. 
The chatbot shall search the entire database for resolution to the problems. If the best solution is found then Chatbot will directly 
provide the solution to the customer's concerned queries. On the contrary , if no solution is found, then chatbot will handover the
problem to the Support Staff available to interpret the query and provide a better solution by interacting with the customer. Having
interacted with the customer and finding new solutions for different queries, the solutions would get updated in the data base wherein
the chatbot shall be prepared to handle similar queries in future.
The Database has been maintained using SQL Alchemy and will be integrated with the NLP engine using Dialogflow APIâ€™s which can accomplish word embedding
intent and entity detection.
